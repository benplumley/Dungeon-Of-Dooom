# Dungeon Of Dooom
Dungeon of Dooom is an online multiplayer dungeon crawler game created in my first year of Computer Science at the University of Bath. It features AI opponents capable of advanced pathfinding based on Dijkstra's Algorithm.

# This Repository
This repository contains only files that were added in the third iteration of the project, meaning all code in the root directory is my own. This isn't enough to compile and run, so the entire project, including some code not written by me, is included in the `full` folder.
